# branching 
1. A branch is essentially a separate copy of your codebase. It allows you to make changes, test features, or fix bugs independently of the main project. The default branch in GitHub is usually called main (or sometimes master).
# Create a new branch
git branch branch_name

# Switch to the new branch
git checkout branch_name

# Shortcut for creating and switching
git checkout -b branch_name
